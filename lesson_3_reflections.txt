Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: I'd want to do it when I use moer than one computer to work on the project. In this way, I can access the project every time and from everywhere.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: To avoid useless commits to be pushed, since sometimes it takes some commits to implement something new or if I'm not satysfied with the new feature and don't want to add it to the project, I can just delete it without pushing it on the remote.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: I use forks when I want to clone a repository on GitHub and store it on a new repository on my GitHub; clones when I want either to save from GitHub or my computer to my computer; branches when I want to create a modifyied version of the project leaving the current one untouched.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: I can work on the most updated version of the project to avoid most conflicts, and, if there is one, I can resolve it in my own computer and then push it.
