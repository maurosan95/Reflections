Q: What happens when you initialize a new repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: A new repository called .git is created. I guess this is the repository where my Git project will be stored.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: It is a temporary repository that takes files from the working directory to add them to the repository. It makes me add all the files I want to to the repository giving me the chance to modify them before commit them all at once.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A: I can compare the files in it before adding them and remove one or more of them if necessary.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A: If I want to, for example, experiment a new feature leaving the master untouched, I can do it using branches, developing the new branch of the project keeping the master the same.

Q: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
A: By drawing it, I can clearly see what commit is related to another and I can see if there are commits that are unrelated.

Q: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
A: The result of merging is a branch with all common and uncommon lines that had not been removed, and we represent the diagram that way to show how we developed them separately.
